            <p>When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)</p>
            <p>One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>

            <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
            <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.</p>

            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home. </p>
